Artificial Intelligence Basics

Machine Learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that 
enables systems to learn and improve from experience without 
being explicitly programmed.

Neural Networks are computing systems inspired by biological 
neural networks. They consist of interconnected nodes (neurons) 
that process and transmit information.

Deep Learning is a subset of machine learning that uses neural 
networks with multiple layers. It excels at processing 
unstructured data like images, audio, and text.
